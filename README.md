### üí° Why TeXeTeScribe

- **Your data is always readable**. Storing notes in plain `.TXT` format makes them viewable and editable on any device - Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, ChromeOS, Smart TVs, e-readers, and cloud drives. Every system understands text.  

- **Your notes survive Android failures**. When Android glitches, encrypts, or bricks itself after an update, files in internal storage become unreadable. Saving notes on a microSD card keeps them visible and copyable in any file manager, even if the phone is dead or replaced.  

- **Your text always displays correctly**. The app detects file encoding automatically - whether UTF-8 (Android), ANSI-1251 (Windows), CP-866 (DOS), MacRoman (macOS), or UTF-32. Most Android apps ignore encodings and show gibberish; TeXeTeScribe ensures text looks right.  

- **You find notes instantly**. The folder view shows a preview of each file and its modification time, helping you locate the right note without opening them one by one.  

- **You always return to your latest thoughts**. Files are sorted by last modification time, so your most recent ideas appear on top - exactly how note-taking works in real life.  

- **You stay offline and private**. No cloud sync, no analytics, no background tasks. Everything stays on your device, in your folders.  

- **You control storage**. Create, rename, and manage notes directly inside user-selected folders using Android‚Äôs built-in file access system.  

- **You work with any text-based file**. Beyond TXT, it opens and edits MD, LOG, INI, CFG, YAML, JSON, XML, CSV, and more.  

- **You never lose progress**. Notes are automatically saved on exit or app minimization, preventing accidental data loss.  

- **You own your data**. No accounts, ads, or hidden databases. Every note is a transparent text file you can move, back up, or open anywhere.
